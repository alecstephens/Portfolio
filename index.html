                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>I've always known that I wanted to have a career that had a focus on technology.</p>
                    <p>However, it wasn't until midway through highschool that I realized that I wanted this career to involve programming.</p>
                    <p>I took one year of computer science at a local community college, and I decided that was enough college for me.</p>
                    <p>I then started a TechDegree course with Team Treehouse, which allowed me to work more along with studying.</p>
                    <p>I eventually finished the course, and now I spend a lot of my time building various programming projects, along with working full-time.</p>
